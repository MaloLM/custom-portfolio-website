## INTRODUCTION

This project is designed to set-up your personal portfolio website, showcasing both personal and professional aspects of an individual's life. It features a comprehensive view of personal projects, hobbies, educational background, professional experiences, and completed work projects. Additionally, the website allows for the download of a resume. All these elements can be conveniently managed through an administrator interface, essentially making this platform a basic Content Management System (CMS).

Example of portfolio based onto this project [HERE](https://portfolio.dopee.io).

This portfolio website is developed using Vue.js 3 and leverages various free services provided by Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. The integration of these technologies ensures a robust and scalable solution, catering to the needs of a dynamic and interactive online portfolio. The key services used in this project include:

- **Firebase Hosting**: Provides fast and secure hosting for web app content.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: A cloud-hosted database that enables real-time data syncing across all clients.
- **Firebase Storage (GCP Bucket)**: Offers secure and scalable object storage for user-generated content like images and documents.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Ensures secure and easy authentication for users, supporting various sign-in methods.
- **App Check with Recaptcha V3**: Protects the website from abusive traffic and enhances security with invisible reCAPTCHA verification.

## DEMONSTRATION
